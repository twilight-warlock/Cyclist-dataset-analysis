# Cyclist Data set: A Case Study

## Project Overview

A fictional company, **Cyclistic**, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

It has been hypothesized that maximizing the number of annual members, versus casual riders, is the key to their future growth. In order to build a new marketing strategy aimed to convert casual riders into Cyclistic members, the questions that would guide to design marketing strategies for the future marketing program are:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would causal riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
