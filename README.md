# Cyclist Data set: A Case Study

## Project Overview

A fictional company, **Cyclistic**, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

It has been hypothesized that maximizing the number of annual members, versus casual riders, is the key to their future growth. In order to build a new marketing strategy aimed to convert casual riders into Cyclistic members, the questions that would guide to design marketing strategies for the future marketing program are:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would causal riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

I will be answering the first question using the 6 steps of data analysis taught in the Google Data Analytics course; ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

## Ask

The director of marketing, is concerned with ensuring this growth by creating a marketing strategy designed to convert casual riders of Cyclistic into annual members. The marketing analytics team, which I am a member of, are concered with using our data to answer the three above questions, and use the answers to guide the marketing program.

The Business Task is to analyze rider's usage patterns for marketing membership conversion programs.

## Prepare

The data used in the project comes is stored in AWS (Amazon Web services). I am using only the past 12 months of trip data, beginning in 2020-06 and ending in 2021-05.
The data is collected directly from Cyclistic and has been made available by Motivate Internation Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). The data has been anonymized and no personally identifiable information has been included in the data. While this will prevent analysis which would examine specific personal traits of individual riders, such as individual history or areas of residence, there is still enough data to identify certain behaviours.
